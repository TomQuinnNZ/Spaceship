# Spaceship
Small spaceship simulator program (Java practice)


Brushing the cobwebs off Java with a small program to simulate the costs of different spaceship types making a trip to Mars!

Emphasis on inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces and classes mostly. Have commented out testing strings but left them in for posterity.

Phase 1 and 2 can be switched out easily by commenting out their method calls in the main method.
